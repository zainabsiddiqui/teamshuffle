# teamshuffle
**Team Shuffle** is an application that streamlines the process of finding groups for class projects and competitive events. It is built using React and Firebase (Cloud Firestore). 

The features we boast are:
- Individual chatrooms for each group so that users can explore each other as well as potential topic ideas
- A dashboard for each user to see at-a-glance what other groups are working on and how many members they have
- User profiles highlighting each user's major, bio, and strengths
- Professor/admin mode which allows the setting of max group size
- Group finalization feature which emails the chosen group's names and topic idea to the professor
- Shuffle feature for those indecisive users who would rather get randomly placed in a group

Here's a sneak peek of what that looks like:
